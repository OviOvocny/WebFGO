# Fate/Grand Order WebGL Card Viewer
Three.js rendering a card from Fate/Grand Order.
Still WIP. Currently implemented card layers can be affected using the dat.GUI controls. 

See [servant](http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/servant_all.php#nav) and [CE](http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/craft_essence.php#nav) list for available IDs.

Drag to rotate the card. Zoom with mouse wheel or pinch. Ctrl or Shift + wheel to change camera angle.
